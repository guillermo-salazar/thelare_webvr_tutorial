## Start - 15 minutes - Danny house rules
- stay in cafeteria area
- reminder where restrooms are
- pair programming (we're going to be working in pairs, one person is on keyboard, the other is giving suggestions and actively listening/talking)
- ask QUESTIONS, what are pomodoros again?
- loter√≠a, Danny will pull out and define 3 terms right after the start of each session
- between each session coaches should get on the same page about pacing (Sai is ahead of me 0_0)

## Session 1 - Lets learn git
- create github account
- create README.md
- teach "git status", "git add .", "git commit"
- enable github pages
- go to your github page and see your helloworld

## Session 2 - Let's redo some javascript
- open browser
- find out shortcuts for developer tools
- type in console.log() and alert
- type in var someString = "someString"; see what happens, play around
- show what objects are and integers
- create html file and embed your local javascript file (this should be basic html + local javascript that prints out an alert and a console.log)
- look at dayOne example in repo, call functions from the developer tools

## Session 3 - add google cardboard api & go through 3 event/hotspot examples
- ask students "what is on 'ready' on 'click' on 'error'"
- define what yaw and pitch is (day 2 example) (yaw = rotate around vertical, pitch horizontal)
- add googlecard sdk, the point is to google and learn how to find it on their own
- open developer console and play around with 'sources'
- show them some functions that we can do with googlecard, should be on the repo

## Session 4 - photosphere example / crop photos
- come back as a group and show them a youtube video [create photosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPs3eIiWRaw)
- break back and get all their photos
- add their image to the site

## Session 5 - pair create new project
- their pair should create new project and add their photos to it

## Session 6 - free time to add more js and ask QUESTIONS
- arrange their photos on the screen using html formatting, maybe Anthony can go around helping people?

## Session 7 - Retro
- students should take their bags with them
- Sai/Jesus will clean up while Danny does retro so we can get DOLLAH OYSTERS
